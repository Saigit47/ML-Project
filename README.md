#Car-Price-Predictor
Car Price Prediction
This repository contains code and resources for predicting car prices using machine learning. The project leverages Python and several libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

Project Overview
Car price prediction is a common task in the automotive industry. In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features such as mileage, engine size, and brand.

Libraries Used
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: Used for numerical computations and array operations.
Scikit-learn: Used for building and evaluating machine learning models.
Streamlit: Used for creating an interactive web app to showcase the model.
